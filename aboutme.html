            My name is Herbie Southern. Previous to this course I have obtained a Degree in Design: Animation, Visual Effects and Game Art from Glyndwr University. I took part in this coding course with Code Nation to try and broaden my skills and learn more about other creative fields that use technology, I also believe that a better understanding of coding will help me in my work with 3D Animation and understanding Game Engines. It has been a great opportunity to test my creative ability and I have learned a lot from the course. I will definitely be continuing to explore the many things you can make with code, Python especially, as I feel I have taken to that quite well.
